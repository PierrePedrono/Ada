    <p>What causes errors in HTML?</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly</strong>,
            then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend

        <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important
            for code behaving correctly. <em><strong>strong</strong></em> strong emphasised? what is this?


        <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's
            look at an example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">link to Mozillahomepage </a>

        <li>And in order to win some time, next time you can use this kind of tools<a
                href=" https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri+with_options">
                https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri+with_options</a></li>

    </ul>
